Insult,Renee Rottingham's Insults,Comeback
Every enemy I've met I've annihilated!,My attacks have left entire islands depopulated!,"With your breath, I'm sure they all suffocated."
You're as repulsive as a monkey in a negligee.,You have the sex appeal of a Shar-Pei.,I look THAT much like your fiancée?
Killing you would be justifiable homicide!,"When I'm done, your body will be rotted and putrified!",Then killing you must be justifiable fungicide.
You're the ugliest monster ever created!,Your looks would make pigs nauseated.,If you don't count all the ones you've dated.
I'll skewer you like a sow at a buffet!,Your lips look like they belong on catch of the day!,"When I'm done with you, you'll be a boneless filet."
"Would you like to be buried, or cremated?","I give you a choice. You can be gutted, or decapitated!","With you around, I'd prefer to be fumigated."
Coming face to face with me must leave you petrified!,Never before have I seen someone so sissified!,Is that your face? I thought it was your backside.
"When your father first saw you, he must have been mortified!","You're a disgrace to your species, you're so undignified!",At least mine can be identified.
You can't match my witty repartee!,Nothing can stop me from blowing you away!,"I could, if you would use some breath spray."
I have never seen such clumsy swordplay!,I have never lost to a melee!,"You would have, but you were always running away."
En garde! Touché!,Your mother wears a toupee!,"Oh, that is so cliché."
"Throughout the Caribbean, my great deeds are celebrated!",My skills with a sword are highly venerated!,Too bad they're all fabricated.
I can't rest 'til you've been exterminated!,Your stench would make an outhouse cleaner irritated!,Then perhaps you should switch to decaffeinated.
"I'll leave you devastated, mutilated, and perforated!",I can't tell you which of my traits leaves you most intimidated.,"Your odor alone makes me aggravated, agitated, and infuriated."
Heaven preserve me! You look like something that's died!,Nothing on this Earth can save your sorry hide!,The only way you'll be preserved is in formaldehyde.
I'll hound you night and day!,You'll find I am dogged and relentless to my prey!,Then be a good dog. Sit! Stay!
